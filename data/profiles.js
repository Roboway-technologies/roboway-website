    about: "Md. Arifin Ahmed Rafi is the CEO and founder of roboway technologies. His vision, which took him to the ocean's depths and high above the clouds, was to connect people through technology. He thinks that robotics can improve and even save lives. His current objective is to use robotics to improve lifestyles and find solutions to problems that arise in daily life. In light of this, a new highway is being built, and robotics will enable individuals to navigate it safely while earning more.  In future by using  robotics, people will live and work in secure environments. This gave him the idea to start a brand that will use robotics technology to enhance the lives of people on a daily basis. Arifin Rafi leads duburi's autonomous and machine vision systems throughout his robotics career. The first autonomous underwater vehicle in Bangladesh is called Duburi. He worked with Laboratory of Space System Engineering & Technology  . Working his way up from the sea to the skies above, he becomes a Wayfinder. He has experience in the Logistics industry and was a CTO. Rafi has acquired knowledge and experience in embedded systems and is confident that embedded  devices will benefit everyone and every sector of the economy. We will have the chance to develop new products for brand-new markets. It's time to take image processing and robotics to the next level because only then will we be able to go to the bottom of the ocean, expand the boundaries of our blue economy, and inaugurate a new era of new space. Robots-as-a-service will change people's lives and make the world smarter, and we can be extremely proud of having started this revolution in Bangladesh.The place where change is made is roboway technologies. With the same philosophy of using robotics technology for people and creating an ecosystem based on robotics-based solutions, he found his other founder and co-founders. Now We have a team of talented and skilled people with backgrounds in business and robotics. It's time to start making changes so that we can better serve the world. Roboway is currently working on developing products based on robotics and developing an ecosystem because we strongly believe that we will improve people's lives. There will soon be a revolution.
